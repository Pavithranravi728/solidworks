Portfolio Introduction

This portfolio presents a collection of mechanical design, CAD, and simulation projects developed using SOLIDWORKS and related engineering tools. The work demonstrates practical skills in mechanical assemblies, power transmission systems, robotic mechanisms, structural design, and simulation-driven engineering validation.

The projects showcased reflect a strong foundation in mechanical engineering principles, combined with hands-on experience in assembly modeling, engineering drawings, finite element analysis (FEM), and computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Emphasis is placed on realistic component layout, manufacturability-aware design, and clear technical documentation aligned with industry standards.

With professional experience in robotic system production, mechanical diagnostics, aviation engineering support, and safety-driven engineering environments, this portfolio highlights the ability to translate conceptual designs into structured, well-documented mechanical solutions.
